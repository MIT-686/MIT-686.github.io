## OVERVIEW
We're very excited to have you in class this semester! Our aim is to make this course as inclusive, diversified, and open as possible, and we will offer an undergraduate and graduate version of the course:
- **6.8611**: Undergraduate version (CI-M component required)
- **6.8610**: Graduate version (no CI-M option)

Note: all Harvard students who wish to take the course must enroll in **6.8610.**

### DESCRIPTION
How can computers understand and leverage text data and human language? Natural language processing (NLP) addresses this question, and in this course students study both modern and classic approaches. We will mainly focus on statistical approaches to NLP, wherein we learn a probabilistic model based on natural language data. This course provides students with a foundation of advanced concepts and **requires students to conduct significant research on an NLP project of their choosing,** culminating with a high-quality paper (5-8 pages). Assessment also includes homework assignments and write-ups for guest lectures. Our goal is to help challenge each student to elicit one's best, and along the way for the course to be one of the most fun and rewarding educational experiences.

## LOGISTICS
### LECTURE
- Tuesdays and Thursdays @ 11am - 12:30pm in 32.123
- Lectures are recorded
- Attendance is *highly encouraged* to fasciliate an enriching learning environment; actively participating can only help your overall course grade in the event of a borderline situation.

### OFFICE HOURS
- Coming Soon

### GRADING
- **Foundation:** Guest Lecture Write-ups: 10% (during lecture for in-person students)
- **Foundation & Application:** Homework assignments: 40% (3 HWs, two weeks for each)
- **Creating New Knowledge:** [Research Project](project): 50% (twelve weeks)

## QUICK ACCESS
- [Canvas](https://canvas.mit.edu/courses/16573): homework assignments and some
- [Project Ideas (coming soon)](): on-going spreadsheet to collaboratively find and create research projects
- [Emergency Helpline](mailto:nlp-staff-fa22@mit.edu): for private concerns, issues, and questions (not course content) 
- [Supplemental Resources](supplemental): a compilation of useful, external resources

## ENROLLMENT
The demand for this course content is extremely high, and we're thrilled to see so many curious students. 380 students have registered for the course, so we are a bit resource-constrained. To provide as smooth of an educational experience as possible, we strongly recommend that every enrolled student has a strong foundation in Machine Learning and meets the pre-reqs.

### PREREQUISITES
No prior NLP experience is expected or necessary, but students must have a basic foundation in probability and calculus, along with strong knowledge of Machine Learning. <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">See the [syllabus](syllabus) for more details, along with HW #0 (ungraded)</span> to assess if your current knowledge is aligned with the pre-req expectations -- you should be able to answer all of the questions without too much difficulty.

### WHAT'S NEW?
NLP is an incredibly fast-moving field! Toward this, we have adjusted this semester's offering from last year's:
- Different homework problems
- Some new lecture content, and we've rearranged the overall narrative
- More rigor and structure to the Research Project (with awards for Best Projects!)
- New guest lectures!

### COURSE NAME
We acknowledge that "Quantitative Methods for NLP" may not be the most clear name. A more apt name would be "Advanced NLP".
