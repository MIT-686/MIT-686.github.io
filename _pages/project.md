You will work in **groups of three or four** (some exceptions to group size will be permitted) on a custom research project of your choosing. The project will span 12 weeks of the semester and will result in:
- a high-quality, conference-style paper (5-8 pages for groups of 3; 6-8 pages for groups of 4. This page limit does not include your required references and the Impact Statement)
- a short presentation of your work; and
- the associated code to reproduce all work

## MOTIVATION
We wish to provide students with not only a solid foundation of advanced concepts, but also the opportunity to conduct _research_ within the field of NLP. That is, students in this course will be expected to demonstrate:
- a strong understanding of the course content, via **homework assignments and the mid-term exam**
- the ability to craft real-world solutions to problems, via **homework assignments** that involve implementing models on actual data
- knowledge of a particular NLP research problem; the ability to pose a related, interesting, unsolved research question; principled approaches that aim to answer the research question

Computer Science, especially Machine Learning and NLP, is a field that progresses at an incredible rate. State-of-the-art models from five years ago are often barely sufficient in serving as baseline models for any particular task. Yet, we want everyone to gain skills that will last them for many years to come. Gaining research experience greatly helps toward this, as it requires critically reading and evaluating the latest, great approaches to a given problem. Then, one must poke holes in the current community-wide state of accepted knowledge (i.e., published research papers at top venues) and formulate specific research questions that the community at large doesn't yet know the answers to. Working toward an answer is immediately fruitful to the problem at hand. More importantly, this process of conducting research, in general, is a healthy mechanism that allows one to continuously learn forever and not rely on knowledge that will inevitably become outdated.

## RESEARCH PAPERS
In the world of research, the currency of knowledge is in the form of _research papers_. Specifically, in Computer Science, the gold standard is **conference papers**, not **journals**, and there are two formats:
- long papers (~8 pages)
- short papers (~4 pages)

Obviously, teaching _how_ to conduct research is beyond the scope of any particular course, as it's the entire purpose of a PhD. However, very briefly, a research paper should:
- identify a concrete problem/issue (e.g., a new problem or an issue discovered with existing work)
- exhaustively and meticulously review and summarize related work (<span style="background-color: #FFFF00">very important</span>)
- offer novel insights or a solution to the problem
- irrefutably defend the proposed solution (e.g., offer new state-of-the-art results with **thorough experiments**). The reader should be left with no doubt that your work is a viable and useful solution to your important problem. Demonstrating this is the crux of your narrative.
- be objectively written (i.e., doesn't editorialize or use first-person pronouns)
- be specific (e.g., no [weasel words](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weasel_word) or fluff)
- not over-generalize or make bold claims beyond what its work demonstrates
- summarize your work/findings to varying degrees and styles (via the Abstract, Introduction, and Conclusion)

It is incredibly fun to brainstorm and try out/implement clever ideas you may have to a problem. As a consequence, it is natural to skimp on the literature review and to get excited about your own ideas. **Don't fall into this trap, as you'll inevitably suffer the consequences in the long run.** For example, it is a horrible experience to spend many weeks or months on a solution, just to later realize that it's already been tried and published. <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">Make sure you thoroughly read related works, as it can save you from unnecessary work and trouble.</span>

### GOLD STANDARD
The top NLP research conferences are:
- ACL
- NAACL (the North American-located version of ACL)
- EACL (the European-located version of ACL)
- EMNLP
- COLING
- AAAI, ICLR, and ICML (these concern AI/ML in general, but some NLP papers are accepted)

All published works from these conferences are made available to the public for free. Simply search for any year's "accepted papers" (e.g., `ACL 2023 accepted papers`). Again, the field moves incredibly fast, so papers' results/models from > 5 years tend to be significantly less relevant. However, it is important to be aware of the full history of the problem, including past approaches from > 5 years ago.
