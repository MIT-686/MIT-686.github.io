## INTRODUCTION
Welcome to <font color="#3778AE">6.861*</font>!

Our world is clearly inundated with digitized information nowadays, most of which is text (e.g., webpages, social media posts, news articles, long-format stories, etc). How can we use computers to “understand”, process, and leverage this information to perform meaningful tasks? **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** is concerned with exactly this. This course will provide you with the opportunity to learn the latest, advanced **machine learning/ deep learning** approaches to solve the most popular and powerful NLP tasks. Further, a core component of the course will concern research, as you’ll produce an **original research project** while working in groups of 3-4 students.

## LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of the course, you will be able to:
- understand the theoretical concepts behind the common NLP tasks and models
- write effective programming solutions to popular problems in NLP
- tackle your own, novel goals with text data once this course is over (e.g., if you have downloaded thousands of tweets over the past week, you’ll be able to come up with reasonable solutions to (1) identify sentiments about any phrase; (2) make classification predictions; (3) identify aliases for any entity, and much more)
- conduct substantial, original NLP research (e.g., critically read papers published in top conferences, understand them, and execute your own ideas so as to answer novel research questions)

## PREREQUISITES
- **NLP**: No previous experience expected or necessary
- **Machine Learning**: basic knowledge of Machine Learning (e.g., Feed-forward Neural Nets, Backpropagation, what train/dev/test splits are, regularization) e.g., <font color="#31493C"><b>6.390 aka 6.036</b></font>
- **Probability and Statistics**: (e.g., 6.370, 6.380, 18.05)
- **Multivariable Calculus**: (e.g., 18.02)
- **Linear Algebra)**: (e.g., 18.061)
- **Algorithms**: (e.g., 6.120, 6.121)
- **Programming**: knowledge of Python and at least one class with substantial object-oriented programming (e.g., 6.100A)

## SOFTWARE
You will program using (a) **Python** and (b) **PyTorch**, extensively. If you are not already familiar with PyTorch, you will be expected to learn it on your own. We will also make use of Python libraries such as **NumPy** and **Scikits-learn**.

## COURSE STRUCTURE
The main delivery of information will be via **Lectures**, which will occur every time class meets (aside from Research Project presentations). Your learning will be assessed via three <font color="#5B90E0"><b>homework assignments</b></font>, guest lecture write-ups, and a significant <font color="#4ECD59"><b>research project (in groups of 3-4 students)</b></font>. Your research project will require you to read/skim dozens of research papers on your own, based on your interests.
