## INTRODUCTION
Welcome to <font color="#3778AE">6.861*</font>!

Our world is clearly inundated with digitized information nowadays, most of which is text (e.g., webpages, social media posts, news articles, long-format stories, etc). How can we use computers to “understand”, process, and leverage this information to perform meaningful tasks? **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** is concerned with exactly this. This course will provide you with the opportunity to learn the latest, advanced **machine learning/ deep learning** approaches to solve the most popular and powerful NLP tasks. Further, a core component of the course will concern research, as you’ll produce an **original research project** while working in groups of 3-4 students.
