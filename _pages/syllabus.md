## INTRODUCTION
Welcome to <font color="#3778AE">6.861*</font>!

Our world is clearly inundated with digitized information nowadays, most of which is text (e.g., webpages, social media posts, news articles, long-format stories, etc). How can we use computers to “understand”, process, and leverage this information to perform meaningful tasks? **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** is concerned with exactly this. This course will provide you with the opportunity to learn the latest, advanced **machine learning/ deep learning** approaches to solve the most popular and powerful NLP tasks. Further, a core component of the course will concern research, as you’ll produce an **original research project** while working in groups of 3-4 students.

## LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of the course, you will be able to:
- understand the theoretical concepts behind the common NLP tasks and models
- write effective programming solutions to popular problems in NLP
- tackle your own, novel goals with text data once this course is over (e.g., if you have downloaded thousands of tweets over the past week, you’ll be able to come up with reasonable solutions to (1) identify sentiments about any phrase; (2) make classification predictions; (3) identify aliases for any entity, and much more)
- conduct substantial, original NLP research (e.g., critically read papers published in top conferences, understand them, and execute your own ideas so as to answer novel research questions)

## PREREQUISITES
- **NLP**: No previous experience expected or necessary
- **Machine Learning**: basic knowledge of Machine Learning (e.g., Feed-forward Neural Nets, Backpropagation, what train/dev/test splits are, regularization) e.g., <font color="#31493C"><b>6.390 aka 6.036</b></font>
- **Probability and Statistics**: (e.g., 6.370, 6.380, 18.05)
- **Multivariable Calculus**: (e.g., 18.02)
- **Linear Algebra)**: (e.g., 18.061)
- **Algorithms**: (e.g., 6.120, 6.121)
- **Programming**: knowledge of Python and at least one class with substantial object-oriented programming (e.g., 6.100A)

## SOFTWARE
You will program using (a) **Python** and (b) **PyTorch**, extensively. If you are not already familiar with PyTorch, you will be expected to learn it on your own. We will also make use of Python libraries such as **NumPy** and **Scikits-learn**.

## COURSE STRUCTURE
The main delivery of information will be via **Lectures**, which will occur every time class meets (aside from Research Project presentations). Your learning will be assessed via three <font color="#5B90E0"><b>homework assignments</b></font>, guest lecture write-ups, and a significant <font color="#4ECD59"><b>research project (in groups of 3-4 students)</b></font>. Your research project will require you to read/skim dozens of research papers on your own, based on your interests.

### <font color="#5B90E0">HOMEWORK ASSIGNMENTS (40%)</font>
There will be three equally-weighted, **individual** homework assignments. See the Collaboration Policy below for details. **Students will have a total of three free late days to use throughout the semester without any penalty.** NOTE: valid excuses (e.g., medical excuses) do not count toward your three allotted “free” late days. <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">Any late days used beyond these three will result in a deduction of 10 points per day.</span>

For example, let’s say a student has already used three free late days earlier in the semester, and then turned in another homework assignment one day late. If the graded homework received a 88%, then it will be reduced to a 78% due to being a day late. If that student had turned in the assignment two days late (meaning, a grand total of five late days used), then that particular assignment would have received a 68%, due to being two days late.

If any particular homework assignment is **late beyond three unexcused days, it will not be accepted or graded.** The grade will be 0%.


### <font color="#5B90E0">GUEST LECTURE WRITE-UPS (10% + EXTRA CREDIT)</font>
We have an exciting line-up of 6 guest lectures for this iteration of the class! For each guest lecture, you will be asked to write up a couple of paragraphs on the guest lecture, in particular:
- What you learned in the lecture
- Any thoughts/questions you had for the speaker.

Guest lecture attendance is required! Each reflection will count for 2% of the grade (2% extra credit).


There is a writing assignment for 6 guest lectures, each of which will be worth 2%.

<font color="#5B90E0"><b>RESEARCH PAPERS:</b></font>
Although we don't grade your reading of research papers, you should be heavily skimming and reading research papers throughout the semester.

### <font color="#4ECD59">RESEARCH PROJECT (50%)</font>
Throughout the semester, students will **work in groups of three** on a research project of their choosing. To help facilitate ideas for projects, we will maintain an on-going, collaborative list from all students.

**Project assessment (percentages listed below are out of the total course grade):**
- Phase 0: Individual Ideas (3%)
- Phase 1: Proposal (5%)
- Phase 2: Related Work + Introduction (ungraded)
- Self-/peer- evaluation (5%)
- Phase 3: Baseline Results (ungraded)
- Self-/peer- evaluation (5%)
- Phase 4: FINAL DELIVERABLES:
  - research paper (5-8 pages for groups of 3 students; 6-8 pages for groups of 4 students) (22%)
  - presentation of your slides (5%)
  - code (5%)

[Further details are listed here](project) and will be discussed in class.

We will provide a few Best Project Awards. Students can cast a vote on their favorites. <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">These awards will be voted on by all students, and each student from an award-winning team will receive <b>extra points to one’s final course grade.</b></span>

## RESOURCES

**No textbook is required.**
- [Canvas](https://canvas.mit.edu/courses/16573): homework assignments
- [Piazza (assessible from Canvas)](https://canvas.mit.edu/courses/16573/external_tools/368): technical discussion and clarifying questions
- [Project Ideas (coming soon)](): on-going spreadsheet to collaboratively find and create research projects
- [Emergency Helpline](mailto:nlp-staff-fa22@mit.edu): for private concerns, issues, and questions (not course-content related) 
- [Supplemental Resources](supplemental): a compilation of useful, external resources

## HELP
Students are encouraged to regularly read and actively participate in **Piazza.** This is intended to be a shared learning environment for all students in the class. Do not post any code on the forum, though. **Doing so will violate our academic integrity policy.**

TAs will hold scheduled **Office Hours** throughout every week. The expectation is that you’ve already thought about the content and have very specific questions. That is, the intent of Office Hours is not to simply repeat the same content again, but to help clarify your understanding by addressing issues you’re currently facing. The TAs may help you with your code, if you've demonstrated that you have already put forth significant effort and aren't relying on them. In an attempt to help as many students as I can in a timely fashion, I will not assist in code.

## COURSE POLICIES
### COLLABORATION POLICY
<span style="background-color: #FFFF00"><b>The homework assignments must be conducted individually.</b></span> However, no single student should feel alone in the course. So, we encourage you to talk with and discuss the assignments with your fellow classmates, but this must be at the _conceptual_ level. That is, <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">no student should ever see another student's solutions or code. Your code must be written exclusively by you. If you post or share your homework assignment online (even if it only contains the questions and not solutions), this violates our academic policy and you will be reported to the university. This includes posting your assignment on GitHub. Do not do this.</span> In other words, your homework assignment is a private copy that only you can see. If you're unsure if something is allowed, please speak with us first. Any violation to the above constitutes Academic Dishonesty and will be reported.
  
We discourage you from using publicly-available code online, as you'll learn more if you write your code from scratch. However, **if you find useful code online that you wish to use, that is perfectly fine, but you must cite it.**

As a reminder, if a student cheats, it is not only harmful to one's own education but it also impacts everyone else in the course -- as it creates an unfair environment and sacrifices the integrity of the entire course. For this reason, we actively check to ensure your code hasn't been plagiarized or posted online.
  
### ACADEMIC HONESTY
Ethical behavior is an important trait of anyone who works in the fields of Computer Science, Machine Learning, Data Science, NLP -- from ethically handling data, to thinking of the ramifications of one’s models, to attribution of code and work of others. Thus, in this course, we place strong emphasis on Academic Honesty.

### COMMUNICATION FROM STAFF TO STUDENTS
Class announcements will be through Canvas
